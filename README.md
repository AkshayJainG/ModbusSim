# ModbusSim
Modbus RTU/TCP simulator with a REST api attached

Looked for a long time for a modbus RTU simulator that could do single server multi-slave simulations and couldn't find anything quite suitable. Something that could be used to rapidly stand-up and teardown various multi-slave setups programatically in modern distributed REST API based systems.

Got a lot of inspiration, especially from [Luc Jean](https://github.com/ljean) and his work on modbus-tk!

Pretty basic but more updates/improvements coming soon - especially documentation!

Running instructions coming soon!
